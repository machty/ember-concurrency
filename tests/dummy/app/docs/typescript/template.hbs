<h3>Using ember-concurrency with TypeScript</h3>

<p>
  The documentation below covers how to use ember-concurrency v2.3+
  with Ember Octane. For older versions of ember-concurrency (or pre-Octane Ember),
  <a href="https://v221.ember-concurrency.com/docs/typescript">please see the old guides</a>.
</p>

<h4>Ember Octane</h4>

<p>
  ember-concurrency tasks play nicely with TypeScript and all of the APIs covered in these docs.
  Here is an example of a TypeScript component with an ember-concurrency task:

<CodeSnippet @name="ts/classic-vs-octane/octane.ts" />

<h4>Version 2.2 and older</h4>

<p>
  Support for TypeScript in ember-concurrency was recently greatly improved and simplified
  with the release of version 2.3, largely due to the introduction of the new
  async arrow task function syntax (e.g. <code>myTask = task(this, async () => {})</code>),
  which alleviated most / all of the prior challenges with getting ember-concurrency tasks
  to play nicely with TypeScript.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>

    </strong>
    is no longer necessary
  </li>
    <li>
    <strong>
      <a href="https://github.com/chancancode/ember-concurrency-ts">ember-concurrency-ts</a>
    </strong>
    and the <code>taskFor()</code> function it provides is no longer necessary
    for interacting with tasks declared using the new syntax.
  </li>
</ul>
