<h3>Example: AJAX Throttling</h3>

<p>
  Limiting the number of simultaneous AJAX requests
  (or the number of any kind of global, shared resource)
  can be accomplished using the <code>maxConcurrency</code> task modifier.
</p>

<p>
  In the example below, we render a component with 8 different
  concurrently running tasks that each, within an infinite loop,
  make (fake) AJAX requests. We've wrapped the code that actually
  performs the (fake) AJAX request in a task, and we've annotated
  that task with <code>@task({ maxConcurrency: 3 })</code> to ensure that
  no more than 3 AJAX requests can be run at a time (so that
  we don't overload the browser).
</p>
