  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> is an Ember Addon that
  makes it easy to write concise, robust, and beautiful
  asynchronous code.
</p>

<p>
  It provides you with a powerful <strong>Task</strong> primitive,
  which offers the following benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Tasks, unlike Promises, support cancelation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks expose their underlying state (whether they're running or idle)
    which makes it trivial to build loading indicators without
    having to manually track / mutate state yourself.
  </li>
  <li>
    <LinkTo @route="docs.task-concurrency">Task Modifiers</LinkTo> make it trivial
    to prevent two executions of the same task from running at the same time, e.g.
    you can prevent double form submissions using the <code>drop</code> modifier,
    or you can configure a task to be <code>restartable</code> so that it starts over
    when you click a "Restart" button. Implementing this logic without tasks requires
    a lot of boilerplate code and defensive programming.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks that live on Components are automatically canceled when that
    Component is unrendered; no more <code>if(this.isDestroyed)</code>
    checks to prevent timers or ajax responses causing
    <code>"set on destroyed object"</code> errors.
  </li>
</ul>
