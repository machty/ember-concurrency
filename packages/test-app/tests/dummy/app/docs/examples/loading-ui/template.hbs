<h3>Loading UI While a Task is Running</h3>

<p>
  Reining in undesired concurrency is partly what <strong>ember-concurrency</strong>
  has to offer. The other part is making it easy to build UI around
  asynchronous tasks.
</p>

<p>
  For simple cases where you just need to display a loading dialog or disable a button
  while a task is running, you can make use of the <code>.isIdle</code> property of
  a task. This property is false when the task is running, and true otherwise. This eliminates
  a lot of the boilerplate of setting a property at the beginning of some async operation,
  and unsetting when the operation completes. Also, because the task in the example
  below uses the <code>drop</code> modifier
  (see <LinkTo @route="docs.task-concurrency">Task Modifiers</LinkTo>),
  there's no need to write a guard at the beginning of the task to return early if
  the task is already running.

<h3>Live Example</h3>

<p>
  What is the meaning of life?
  {{#if this.result}} Answer: {{this.result}} {{/if}}

</p>

<p>
  {{! BEGIN-SNIPPET ask-button }}
  <button class={{if this.askQuestion.isIdle "button-primary"}}
    {{on "click" (perform this.askQuestion)}} type="button">
    {{#if this.askQuestion.isIdle}}
      Ask
    {{else}}
      Thinking...
      <LoadingSpinner />
    {{/if}}
  </button>
  {{! END-SNIPPET }}
</p>
