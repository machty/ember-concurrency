# Known Typings

This is a list of all known typings specific to the Ember.js ecosystem. (You'll of
course find many other modules with their own typings out there.)

Don't see an addon you use listed here? You might be the one to write them! Check
out [this blog post] or [this quest issue] for tips on how to do it, and feel free
to ask for help in the `#e-typescript` channel on the [Ember Community Discord server].
